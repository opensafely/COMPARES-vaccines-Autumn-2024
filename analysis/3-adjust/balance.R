# Purpose:
# use one of 3 methods to balance pre-treatment variables across treatment groups
#
#
# 1. "match" ---
# match productA recipients to productB recipients using MatchIt package
#
#
# 2. "weight" ---
# use IPW to create a weighted pseudo population such that covariates are balanced across treatment groups
#
#
# 3. "lmw" ---
# use the weights that are implied if we had used linear regression to balance the outcome and estimate the effect of a binary treatment
# these weight can be obtained without using the outcome variable!
#
#

## Import design elements

## import command-line arguments ----

## create output directories ----
