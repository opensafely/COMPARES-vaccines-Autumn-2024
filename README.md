# Protocol details

*COMPARES-vaccines: a COMmon Protocol for the Analysis of Relative Effectiveness and Safety of Covid-19 vaccine products*

## Overview

This repository contains analytic code for a common analytic protocol, applicable to a chosen Covid-19 vaccination campaign in England, 
to make head-to-head comparisons between the vaccine products used in that campaign.

The Protocol accommodates the following campaign-specific characteristics:

* start and end dates
* vaccine products 
* study eligibility criteria

This repo should be forked (maybe - TBD) when starting an analysis for the next campaign. 

## Repository navigation

- The [`codelists/`](./codelists/) directory contains all the codelists used to define variables in analysis. 
- The [`analysis/`](./analysis) directory contains the executable scripts used to conduct the analysis. 
- The [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) defines run-order and dependencies for all the analysis scripts.
**This file should *not* be edited directly**. To make changes to the yaml, edit and run the [`analysis/lib-0/create-project.R`](./analysis/lib-0/create-project.R) script instead.
- Non-disclosive model outputs, including tables, figures, etc, are available via the OpenSAFELY job server.

## Analysis scripts

The analysis scripts in the [`analysis/`](./analysis) directory are organised into sub-directories as follows:

- [`0-lib/`](./analysis/0-lib/):
  - [`design.R`](./analysis/0-lib/design.R) defines the campaign-specific design elements (or parameters) used throughout the study (eligibility, products, etc).
  It also defines matching and weighting specification, look-up dictionaries, and other useful objects. 
  This script is run at the start of all subsequent R scripts, 
  including the [`create-project.R`](./analysis/lib-0/create-project.R)script to ensure study-wide parameters are passed to the dataset definition via the project.yaml.
  - [`create-project.R`](./analysis/lib-0/create-project.R) creates the [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) file defining action outputs and dependencies.
  - [`utility.R`](./analysis/0-lib/utility.R) defines functions used throughout the codebase. This script is run at the start of all subsequent R scripts.
  - [`study-dates.json`](./analysis/0-lib/study-dates.json) defines the key dates of the specific campaign under study.
- [`1-extract/`](./analysis/1-extract/):
  - [`dataset_definition.py`](./analysis/1-extract/dataset_definition.py) is the script defining the dataset to extract from the database, using ehrQL. 
  - [`dummy_dataset_definition.R`](./analysis/1-extract/dummy_dataset_definition.R) defines a custom dummy dataset.  
  This can be used instead of the dummy data created by ehrQL when it is necessarily to have more control over the structure in the data, 
  such as more realistic vaccination dates or event rates.
  If the dataset definition is updated, this script must also be updated to ensure variable names and types match.
  - [`variables.py`](./analysis/1-extract/variables.py) contains some function and variable definitions to be read in by the dataset definition.
  - [`codelist.py`](./analysis/1-extract/codelists.py) pulls the codelists from the [`codelists/`](./codelists/) directory to be usable in the dataset definition. 
- [`2-select/`](./analysis/2-select/):
  - [`prepare.R`](./analysis/2-select/prepare.R) imports the extracted database data (or dummy data), standardises some variables and derives some new ones.
  - [`select.R`](./analysis/select.R) applies the inclusion criteria to the extracted data and creates a small table used for the inclusion/exclusion flowchart.
- [`3-adjust/`](./analysis/3-adjust/):
  
  - [`balance.R`](./analysis/3-adjust/balance.R) (`cohort`, `method`, `spec`) runs a script to balance characteristics across vaccine groups.
  It uses different _methods_, each of which attempts to obtain balance on baseline variables:
    - If `method  = "match"` then it runs a matching algorithm to pair recipients of product A with product B, with matching criteria determined by `spec`. 
    It outputs a dataset containing the matching "weights" (`0`/`1`), and a matching ID. 
    - If `method  = "weight"` then it estimates a propensity model to estimate the probability of receipt of product A versus product B, with the model determined by `spec`. 
    It outputs a dataset containing the person-specific weights. 
    - If `method  = "lmw"` then it derives the weights that are implied if running a linear outcome regression model, with one model for each product.
    These weights can be obtained independently of the outcome. 
    It outputs a dataset containing the person-specific weights. 
  - [`report.R`](./analysis/3-adjust/report.R) (`cohort`, `method`, `spec`) describes baseline information for the matched or weighted or lmw method
  eg Table 1 type cohort characteristics, post-weighting balance checks.
  - [`combine-weights.R`](./analysis/3-adjust/combine-weights.R) (`cohort`) combines weights across all weighted and matched analyses for the given cohort.
  Also calculates the Effective sample size based on the weights. 
  - [`match-coverage.R`](./analysis/3-adjust/match-coverage.R) (`cohort`, `spec`) describes matching rates over calendar time.
- [`4-constrast/`](./analysis/4-constrast/):
  - [`aj.R`](./analysis/4-constrast/aj.R) (`cohort`, `method`, `spec`, `subgroup`, `outcome`) derives Aalen-Johansen survival estimates for each product and calculates relative risk and risk differences. 
  This is largely based on the OpenSAFELY Kaplan-Meier reusable action, with an extension to AJ estimates.
  - [`plr.R`](./analysis/4-constrast/plr.R) (`cohort`, `method`, `spec`, `subgroup`, `outcome`) compares cumulative incidence curves between products using pooled logistic regression. 
  - [`combine-contrasts.R`](./analysis/4-contrast/combine-contrasts.R) collects treatment contrasts from the [`aj.R`](./analysis/aj.R) and [`plr.R`](./analysis/plr.R) scripts.

Scripts may take one or more arguments:

- `cohort`, the name of the cohort to be analysed, defined in the [`design.R`](./analysis/0-lib/design.R) script.
- `spec`, the matching or weighting specification, taking values _A_, _B_, _C_, etc for convenience, and fully defined in the [`design.R`](analysis/0-lib/design.R) script.
For matching, `spec` is the set of variables to match on. For weighting, `spec` is the model formula passed to the `weightit()` function. 
- `method`, taking values _match_ or _weight_ or _lmw_.
- `subgroup`, the subgroup variable. Cumulative incidences will be calculated separately within each level of this variable. 
Choose _all_ for no subgroups (i.e., the main analysis). Choose _<variable>_ to select a specific variable to stratify on.
This variable must be exactly matched in the matching run if using `method="match"`, and must be used as a stratification variable if using `method="weight"` (this requirement is under review!)
- `outcome`, the outcome of interest, for example _covid_admitted_ or _covid_death_.

## Workspace

This will appear on [the job server page for the ECHO project](https://jobs.opensafely.org/echo-evaluation-of-covid-19-vaccine-histories-using-opensafely/) when it is ready to be run for the first time.
